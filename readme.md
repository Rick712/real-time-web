# Real Time Web course repo
This is the course repo for the 2018 edition of the course 'Real Time Web' which is part of the minor 'web' taught at the University of Applied Sciences Amsterdam.
The goal of the course is to learn how to create a real time web app from scratch.

## Main task
The task of the user(s) is to write a story with each other. Each user can enter a sentence or paragraph to the story, but need to be carefull to enter the sentence as fast as possible, since everyone can submit a sentence or paragraph at any time.
The web app is just made to have fun, and maybe create a meaningfull story with other people.
